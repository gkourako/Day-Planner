# Day-Planner

Welcome to your new day planner!  

This day planner is built with HTML, CSS, and JQuery also utilizing an API.  I made this day planner so users can elegantly plan their day's work at a simple glance! Through out the day, your planner's time slots will change color indicating time in the past(grey),present(red), and future(green). By clicking the save button, you will save your tasks in local storage so you can always get back to it.
